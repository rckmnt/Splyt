# Splyt UI

This is the start to a parametric WebGL UI for creating Splyt Lights. Splyt lights have only a few pieces and can be built upon by screwing Splyts together.

### TODO


- Separate class for each piece.
- Each class should have an input matrix and two corresponding output matrices for placing bulbs or more Splyt pieces.
- Drag 'n' drop UI for more pieces.
- Environment and material fixup.
